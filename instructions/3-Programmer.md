### Exercise A - Programmer

Your main task will be to provide the dataset - i.e. the starting point for the Engineer.
We will do so by inventing our own universe in which we dictate the laws of physics.
By chance, the laws will be similar to our own universe, but we will not tell this
fact to the engineer. In order to generate these dataset we develop a set of tools,
which we can then execute.

You start to work on the `src/generate.py` file - take a look there!
