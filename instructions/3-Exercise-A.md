### Exercise A

We rediscover gravity by observing on how ski jumping works.
We will study datasets which describe the trajectory and then find out that they lay all on a parabola.

Up front, we make a contract that we will assume that we put the origin of the coordinate system at
the tip of the jump, to make our life a bit easier.

The different groups have different tasks, which are discussed on the respective pages:
1. [CEO](./3-CEO.md)
1. [Programmer](./3-Programmer.md)
1. [Engineer](./3-Engineer.md)
