### Setup

You need your own version of this repository, where you can actually change the content as much as you like and which is not bound to me.
The captain (and only them) need to execute the following steps:
 
1. Create a new repository in GitHub under your account.
   Choose a meaningful name and description, else you can keep the repository completely empty - we will import some content next.
1. Clone the template repository: `git clone https://github.com/felixhekhorn/topi-git-template.git`
1. Change the origin (i.e. the source of truth) of the repository to your personal repo: `git remote set-url --all origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<your-repo>.git`
1. Push the current state to _your_ repository: `git push`
1. Add the other team members as Collaborators in GitHub to your repo: Security -> Collaborators -> "Add people"
